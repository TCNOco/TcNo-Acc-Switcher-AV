## TcNo Account Switcher - False Positives

If you're seeing this you're likely looking into the [TcNo Account Switcher's](https://github.com/TCNOco/TcNo-Acc-Switcher) binaries to verify they are true false positives.

This software is completely open source, and built in the public as well through [AppVeyor](https://github.com/TCNOco/TcNo-Acc-Switcher/blob/master/appveyor.yml).

Binaries are then zipped and uploaded to the TcNo Account Switcher's release page directly.
